That left-over shaft is not shown.\n//    Instead, it is sliced off because the span's CSS has overflow: hidden.\n//    Thus, the reader sees an arrow that matches the subject matter width\n//    without distortion.\n//    Some functions, such as \\cancel, need to vary their aspect ratio. These\n//    functions do not get the overflow SVG treatment.\n// Second Brush Stroke\n//    Low resolution monitors struggle to display images in fine detail.\n//    So browsers apply anti-aliasing. A long straight arrow shaft therefore\n//    will sometimes appear as if it has a blurred edge.\n//    To mitigate this, these SVG files contain a second \"brush-stroke\" on the\n//    arrow shafts. That is, a second long thin rectangular SVG path has been\n//    written directly on top of each arrow shaft. This reinforcement causes\n//    some of the screen pixels to display as black instead of the anti-aliased\n//    gray pixel that a  single path would generate. So we get arrow shafts\n//    whose edges appear to be sharper.\n// In the katexImagesData object just below, the dimensions all\n// correspond to path geometry inside the relevant SVG.\n// For example, \\overrightarrow uses the same arrowhead as glyph U+2192\n// from the KaTeX Main font. The scaling factor is 1000.\n// That is, inside the font, that arrowhead is 522 units tall, which\n// corresponds to 0.522 em inside the document.\n\n\nconst katexImagesData = {\n  //   path(s), minWidth, height, align\n  overrightarrow: [[\"rightarrow\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  overleftarrow: [[\"leftarrow\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  underrightarrow: [[\"rightarrow\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  underleftarrow: [[\"leftarrow\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  xrightarrow: [[\"rightarrow\"], 1.469, 522, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  xleftarrow: [[\"leftarrow\"], 1.469, 522, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  Overrightarrow: [[\"doublerightarrow\"], 0.888, 560, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  xRightarrow: [[\"doublerightarrow\"], 1.526, 560, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  xLeftarrow: [[\"doubleleftarrow\"], 1.526, 560, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  overleftharpoon: [[\"leftharpoon\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  xleftharpoonup: [[\"leftharpoon\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  xleftharpoondown: [[\"leftharpoondown\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  overrightharpoon: [[\"rightharpoon\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  xrightharpoonup: [[\"rightharpoon\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  xrightharpoondown: [[\"rightharpoondown\"], 0.888, 522, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  xlongequal: [[\"longequal\"], 0.888, 334, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  xtwoheadleftarrow: [[\"twoheadleftarrow\"], 0.888, 334, \"xMinYMin\"],\n  xtwoheadrightarrow: [[\"twoheadrightarrow\"], 0.888, 334, \"xMaxYMin\"],\n  overleftrightarrow: [[\"leftarrow\", \"rightarrow\"], 0.888, 522],\n  overbrace: [[\"leftbrace\", \"midbrace\", \"rightbrace\"], 1.6, 548],\n  underbrace: [[\"leftbraceunder\", \"midbraceunder\", \"rightbraceunder\"], 1.6, 548],\n  underleftrightarrow: [[\"leftarrow\", \"rightarrow\"], 0.888, 522],\n  xleftrightarrow: [[\"leftarrow\", \"rightarrow\"], 1.75, 522],\n  xLeftrightarrow: [[\"doubleleftarrow\", \"doublerightarrow\"], 1.75, 560],\n  xrightleftharpoons: [[\"leftharpoondownplus\", \"rightharpoonplus\"], 1.75, 716],\n  xleftrightharpoons: [[\"leftharpoonplus\", \"rightharpoondownplus\"], 1.75, 716],\n  xhookleftarrow: [[\"leftarrow\", \"righthook\"], 1.08, 522],\n  xhookrightarrow: [[\"lefthook\", \"rightarrow\"], 1.08, 522],\n  overlinesegment: [[\"leftlinesegment\", \"rightlinesegment\"], 0.888, 522],\n  underlinesegment: [[\"leftlinesegment\", \"rightlinesegment\"], 0.888, 522],\n  overgroup: [[\"leftgroup\", \"rightgroup\"], 0.888, 342],\n  undergroup: [[\"leftgroupunder\", \"rightgroupunder\"], 0.888, 342],\n  xmapsto: [[\"leftmapsto\", \"rightarrow\"], 1.5, 522],\n  xtofrom: [[\"leftToFrom\", \"rightToFrom\"], 1.75, 528],\n  // The next three arrows are from the mhchem package.\n  // In mhchem.sty, min-length is 2.0em.

no-constant-condition:0 */\n\n/**\n * This file contains the parser used to parse out a TeX expression from the\n * input. Since TeX isn't context-free, standard parsers don't work particularly\n * well.\n *\n * The strategy of this parser is as such:\n *\n * The main functions (the `.parse...` ones) take a position in the current\n * parse string to parse tokens from. The lexer (found in Lexer.js, stored at\n * this.gullet.lexer) also supports pulling out tokens at arbitrary places. When\n * individual tokens are needed at a position, the lexer is called to pull out a\n * token, which is then used.\n *\n * The parser has a property called \"mode\" indicating the mode that\n * the parser is currently in. Currently it has to be one of \"math\" or\n * \"text\", which denotes whether the current environment is a math-y\n * one or a text-y one (e.g. inside \\text). Currently, this serves to\n * limit the functions which can be used in text mode.\n *\n * The main functions then return an object which contains the useful data that\n * was parsed at its given point, and a new position at the end of the parsed\n * data.
